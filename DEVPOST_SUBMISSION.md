# 🤖 Agent Battle Simulator - AI Champion Ship Hackathon Submission

## 🎯 Tagline
**21 autonomous AI agents battle in a strategic turn-based arena with unique abilities, progression systems, and emergent gameplay.**

---

## 📝 Inspiration

The idea came from exploring how multiple AI agents can interact, compete, and evolve in a controlled environment. We wanted to create a system where each agent has distinct personalities, abilities, and strategies—making every battle unique and unpredictable.

Traditional games have pre-programmed NPCs. We asked: **What if each opponent was an autonomous agent with its own decision-making process?**

## 🚀 What it does

**Agent Battle Simulator** is a web-based turn-based strategy game featuring:

### 🤖 21 Unique AI Agents
Each agent has:
- **Distinct personality** (Office Warrior, AI Agent, Gaming Legend, etc.)
- **Unique stats** (HP, Attack, Defense, Stamina bonuses)
- **3 special abilities** tailored to their role
- **1 passive power** that defines their playstyle
- **Visual identity** (color-coded avatars)

### 🎨 Progression System
- **XP-based leveling** with stat increases
- **5 skins per agent** (105 total) unlocked at levels 1, 5, 10, 15, 20
- **Visual evolution** as agents grow stronger

### ⚔️ Strategic Combat
- **8 unique actions** with different stamina costs and effects
- **Buff/Debuff system** for tactical depth
- **AI opponent** that adapts to player strategy
- **Real-time combat commentary** for engagement

### 🎮 User Experience
- **Bot selection screen** with visual cards
- **Live battle visualization** with HP/Stamina/XP bars
- **Responsive design** (Desktop & Mobile)
- **Retro gaming aesthetic** (Courier New, neon colors)
